Homework 2: Normal/Abnormal ECG Signals and EDA Reactivity Visualization and Analysis

Project Description:

The homework assignment is based on two problems:
Problem 1 is concerned with interpretation of normal and abnormal ECG signals. In this task, we work with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database to visualize both ECG components and premature ventricular beats. Following after, we implement the Pan-Tomkins algorithm to detect the QRS complex of signals so that we can detect actual signals versus detected signals and distinguish between them to account for irregular ventricular beats.
Problem 2 studies individual’s EDA recorded responses to multimedia. In the problem, we are tasked to visualize and extract key features in participants’ EDA signals and examine correlations between said signals and participants’ self reported responses to observed media.

Language: Python embedded in Jupyter-notebook
