In-class Tutorial: Physiological Signals

Project Description:

The tutorial is based on two problems:
Problem 1 is concerned with performing a Fourier-Transform of synthetic signals. In this problem, we needed to generate a clean synthetic signal with specific fundamental frequencies and visualize them individually and their combination. Next, we compute the Fourier transform of each signal with a specific number of sample points and visualize its spectrum over a given frequency space. Finally, we created a noisy signal (Gaussian), applied the Fourier transform, plot its spectrum, and used and compared its outputs to a low-pass filter version of the same noisy signal.
Problem 2 studies focus on the application of the Fourier-Transform applied to ECG signals, based on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. In this task, we visualized normal ECG signals, computed the ECG components by way of Fourier transform, detected the QRS through the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, and finally, visualized the Fourier computation of PVC beats.
