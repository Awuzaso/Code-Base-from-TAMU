Homework 3: Convolution Operation and Principle Component Analysis (Face Recognition on Yale Face Dataset) Implementation
Project Description
The homework assignment demonstrates:
How to implement a convolution  of 1-dimensional and 2 dimensional signals, using different filters, noting how said filters influence the output signal.
How to implement a principle component analysis algorithm on the Yale Faces dataset and face recognition by way of classification approaches. For more information, see hw2.pdf included in the directory.
Language
